# Alzheimer's Disease Patient Data
This is a project I completed using a dataset from Kaggle called "Alzheimer's Disease Patient Data": "This dataset is a comprehensive collection of health records for 2,149 patients who have been diagnosed with or are at risk for Alzheimer's disease." (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadehsan02/alzheimers-disease-patient-data)


I will be using SQL and Python to analyze the data.
